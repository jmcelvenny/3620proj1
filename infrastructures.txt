I. Stampede Cluster
1.User Guide: https://portal.xsede.org/tacc-stampede
2.Operating System: Linux
3.Scheduler: Slurm
4.File System(s): Three Lustre parallel distributed file systems
5.CloudLab site that best represents architecture: Clemson
  The Stampede cluster is a Dell Linux cluster, designed to offer "large memory, large data transfer, and GPU capabilities for data-intensive computing." High speed data servers are also integrated into the file systems. As the Clemson CloudLab site is a Dell cluster that primarily provides high-memory nodes and a high capacity network (up to 40 Gb), it serves as a good fit. 


II. Gordon Cluster
1. https://portal.xsede.org/sdsc-gordon
2. Linux/Rocks
3. Torque
4. SDSC's Lustre Data Oasis
5. I think the Utah site is ideal for this infrastructure because it has flash memory available to its users. Flash-based I/O nodes may offer significant performance improvement for applications that exhibit random access data patterns or require fast access to significant amounts of scratch space.
