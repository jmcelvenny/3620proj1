I. Beacon
1. User Guide: https://www.nics.utk.edu/beacon
2. Operating System: Linux
3. Scheduler: MAOB workload manager, Torque resource manager 
4. File System(s): NFS, Lustre, Local SSD
5. CloudLab site that best represents architecture: Wisconsin
  The Beacon cluster places emphasis on its high memory nodes with large amounts of SSD storage. The Wisconsin site provides many nodes with multiple cores and network I/O performance, as well as large amounts of high-speed SSD storage. 

II. Stampede
1. User Guide: https://portal.xsede.org/tacc-stampede
2. Operating System: Linux
3. Scheduler: Slurm
4. File System(s): Three Lustre parallel distributed file systems
5. CloudLab site that best represents architecture: Clemson
  The Stampede cluster is a Dell Linux cluster, designed to offer "large memory, large data transfer, and GPU capabilities for data-intensive computing." High speed data servers are also integrated into the file systems. As the Clemson CloudLab site is a Dell cluster that primarily provides high-memory nodes and a high capacity network (up to 40 Gb), it serves as a good fit.

2. Linux/Rocks
3. Torque
4. SDSC's Lustre Data Oasis
5. I think the Utah site is ideal for this infrastructure because it has flash memory available to its users. Flash-based I/O nodes may offer significant performance improvement for applications that exhibit random access data patterns or require fast access to significant amounts of scratch space. 

IV. Wrangler
1. User Guide: https://portal.xsede.org/tacc-wrangler
2. Operating System: Linux (CentOS)
3. Scheduler: SLURM
4. File Systems: Lustre, NFS, HDFS, GPFS
5. I think the Wisconsin site is ideal for this infrastructure due to the similar hardware setups. Both of these have large amounts of DDR4 ECC memory and a similar amont of nodes. Each node provides similar resources to the user.
